# BuyCar Server

<h5>
Here, four APIs are used. The first one is 'cars' where all of the car models are shown. The second one is 'purchases' where the user's orders are shown. The third one is the collection of all 'users' where we can know who are admins and who are normal users. The last one is for the collection of all reviews of customers.
